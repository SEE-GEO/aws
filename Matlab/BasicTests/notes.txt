Absorption:
-
O2 can be ignored above 150 GHz, except around the few O2-transitions the exist
above 150 GHz.
N2 significant impact, more at 325 than 183 GHz.
For range 150-340 GHz many lines in MPM89 can be ignored, keeping differecnes
below a few 0.01 K. The function select_mpm_lines.m sets the lines to keep.

The final settings are found in q_basic.m.


f_grid:

The idea is to perform monochromatic calculations at equidistant points over
the full band. Here each side of 325 GHz line will be seen as an individual
band. The Tb over the full band is estimated by and interpolation or a
polynomial fit. The later would be to prefer as it would allow to analytically
inegrate Tb over frequncy ranges (assuming rectangular channerl response).
However, it was found that polynomial fitting requires more frequencies and the
option was rejected.
The lower 325 GHz band was found to be the most problematic to interpolate.
Also higher surface reflectivity was harder to handle.
Spline was found to work a bit better than pchip (cubic).  
Settings for testing provided by test_f_input.m
Actual testing done test_f_interp.m
Example
>> [f_grid,f_lims,f_chs,f0] = test_f_input('325u');
>> test_f_interp(f_grid,f_lims,f_chs,0.4,10,8);

Eight frequencies per 183 and 325 GHz sideband maintains the error below 0.1K.
In most cases with good margin.
For 166 and 229 GHz, two frequencies suffice.
These frequencies are presently suggested
166 : 166.50e9 + [-0.8 0.8]*1e9
183l: 183.31e9 + linspace(-8,-0.8,8)*1e9;
229 : 229.00e9 + [ -1 1 ]*1e9;
325l: 325.15e9 + linspace(-9,-0.75,8)*1e9;
325u: 325.15e9 + linspace(0.75,9,8)*1e9;
-
This gives in total 28 frequencies. A bit high!
