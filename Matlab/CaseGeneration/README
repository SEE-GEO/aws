Software needed:

Atmlab: svn co https://arts.mi.uni-hamburg.de/svn/rt/atmlab/trunk/ atmlab
---
See atmlab/CONFIGURE for instructions how to configure atmlab. Most important is
that atmlab_init is run automatically when you start Matlab.

CloudArts: svn co http://cvs.rss.chalmers.se/svn/gem/patrick/Projects/CloudArts
---
Edit init_aws325ghz.m (part of this project) to include CloudArts

Static data: 

atmlab-data : svn co  https://arts.mi.uni-hamburg.de/svn/rt/atmlab-data/trunk atmlab-data

Edit init_aws325ghz.m to include atmlab-data, add the following line to the user 
atmlab('ATMLAB_DATA_PATH', '/path/to/atmlab-data')

Further:

Dendrite must be mounted. For the moment it is assumed that the mounting point
is ~/Dendrite.

To get started, check if you can run test.m. You need to add path to a
"workfolder". Note that unzipped CloudSat files are left in that folder.
